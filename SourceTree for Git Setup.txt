Configuring SourceTree for Git:
1. In your ".gitconfig" file usually located in your windows user folder, add the following lines

	[mergetool "unityyamlmerge"]
		cmd = '%LOCATION OF UNITY INSTALL FOLDER%/Editor/Data/Tools/UnityYAMLMerge.exe' merge -p $BASE $REMOTE $LOCAL $MERGED
		trustExitCode = true

2. In "mergespecfile.txt" usually located in your unity install folder +"/Editor/Data/Tools/", change the lines:

	unity use "%programs%\YouFallbackMergeToolForScenesHere.exe" "%l" "%r" "%b" "%d"
	prefab use "%programs%\YouFallbackMergeToolForPrefabsHere.exe" "%l" "%r" "%b" "%d"

to

	unity use "%programs%\Perforce\p4merge.exe" "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$MERGED"
	prefab use "%programs%\Perforce\p4merge.exe" "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$MERGED"

and add the general fallback: 

	* use "%programs%\Perforce\p4merge.exe" "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$MERGED"

(NB this is if you have p4merge as your default diff tool. Adjust accordingly!)

3. In SourceTree goto Repository -> Git Flow -> Initialize and accept the defaults (add "v" in version tag). This enables easy feature creation.

4. When/if asked to install LFS for git in SourceTree, say yes! Otherwise goto Repository -> Git LFS -> Initialize.
